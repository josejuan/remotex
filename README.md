# remotex

I use it to control my HTPC from my touch device.

I made this version because Java consumes a lot of memory (see https://github.com/josejuan/remotex11)

## Currently

1. hardware mouse and keyboard emulation.
1. only X11 server (use Java version for window users).
1. any touch device (through web browser).
1. easy keyboard layout keys recognition.
